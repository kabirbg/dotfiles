# DOTFILES

These are my personal dotfiles for macOS and Linux (current setup is bspwm + Void), using (yadm)[https://yadm.io].

## Installation

Dotfiles are meant for my personal use but in case you would like to use some or all of these, install yadm following instructions on (website)[https://yadm.io] and then run `yadm clone git://github.com/kabirbg/dotfiles` to initialize an empty git repo with my dotfiles. This will overwrite any previous yadm repos.
