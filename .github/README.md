# DOTFILES

These are my personal dotfiles for macOS and Linux (current setup is bspwm + Void), using [yadm](https://yadm.io).

## Installation

Dotfiles are meant for my personal use but in case you would like to use some or all of these, install yadm following instructions on [website](https://yadm.io) and then run `yadm clone git://github.com/kabirbg/dotfiles` to initialize an empty git repo with my dotfiles. This will overwrite any previous yadm repos.

The bootstrap script is included to install everything else that I might need (oh-my-zsh, homebrew, etc). Run `brew bundle --global` manually or with the bootstrap to install needed packages on a new macOS system.
